## Physical overview

The most important component is the DC (Domain Controller).

Host the ADDS (the phone book). Provide authentication and much more.

### AD DS data store.

COnsists of the Ntds.dit file

stored by default in `%SystemRoot%\NTDS` folder on all domain controllers

Contain all information on everything, including password.

## Logical overview

### AD DS Schema

Define every type of object that can be stored in the directory.

Enforces rules about object creation/configuration

### Domains

Domains are used to group and manage objects in an organization.

### Trees

A domain tree is a hierarchy of domains in AD DS

All domains in the tree :

- Share a contiguous namespace with the parent domain
- Can have additional child domains
- By default create a two-way transitive trust with other domains

### Forests

A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees

- Share a common schema
- Share a common configuration partition
- Share a common global catalog to enable searching
- Enable trust between all domains in the forest
- Share the Entreprise Admins and Schema Admins groups

### OU

AD containers that can contain users, groups, computers and other OUs

### Trusts

Trusts provide a mechanism for users t o gazin access to ressources in another domain.

| Types of trusts | Description                                                                                   |
|:---------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Directional     | The trust direction flows from trusting domain to the trusted domain                          |
| Transitive      | The trust relationship is extended beyond a two-domain trust to include other trusted domains |


### Objects

Objets are the common name of any managed entity in an OU
