# Initial attack vector

## LLMNR Poisoning

### Overview

- Used to identify host when DNS fails to do so
- Previously NBT-NS
- Key flaw is that the service utilize user's username and NTLMv2 hash when appropriately responded to

### Tools

- Responder
 - Launching responder first asap allow to catch more easily DNS traffic (in the morning or after lunch)
- Hashcat to crack the hash we got in Responder
